# Pokedex features:

The project involves developing a Pokédex web application using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The application displays information for the Pokémon and provides search boxes for searching a Pokémon. Input validation is implemented to ensure data integrity.

The pokemon list is updated in real-time as the user types or deletes characters in the search boxes, ensuring a seamless and responsive interface. When the search box is empty, the new content block automatically disappears, optimizing screen space and maintaining a clean user interface. HTML code is validated using the validator.w3.org tool to ensure compliance with standards and eliminate errors or warnings. The CSS styling applied to the new content block provides a visually appealing and modern design.

## Tech Stack:

HTML: Markup language for creating the Pokédex application interface.
JavaScript: Scripting language for dynamic DOM manipulation and real-time updates.
CSS: Styling language used to create visually distinct content blocks.
validator.w3.org: Tool for validating HTML code and ensuring compliance with industry standards.
